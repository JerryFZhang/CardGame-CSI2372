//Deck will initially hold all the cards which will have to be shuffled to produce a randomized order, then players' hands are dealt and during game play players draw cards from the Deck. There is no insertion into the Deck. Deck can therefore usefully extend a std::vector.
/*
 Deck is a simple derived class from std::vector.
 Card* draw() returns and removes the top card from the deck.
 Also add the insertion operator to insert all the cards in the deck to an std::ostream.
 The Deck needs a constructor which accepts an std::istream and reconstructs the deck from file. Deck( std::istream&, CardFactory* )
