//Hand is well mapped by a queue since players have to keep their hand in order and the first card drawn is the first card played. The only derivation from this pattern is if players discard a card from the middle in Step 4 in the above description of a player's turn. Therefore, we can use a std::vector to remove at an arbitrary location with a std::queue adapter. This will make removal somewhat inefficient, i.e., O(n) but it is rare and we can accept it
/*
 Hand& operator+=(Card*) adds the card to the rear of the hand
 Card* play() returns and removes the top card from the player's hand.
 Card* top() returns but does not remove the top card from the player's hand.
 Card* operator[](int) returns and removes the Card at a given index.
 Also add the insertion operator to print Hand on an std::ostream. The hand should print all the cards in order.
 Hand needs a constructor which accepts an std::istream and reconstruct the Hand from file. Hand( std::istream&, CardFactory* )
