//TradeArea needs random access as the cards are removed from the area depending on which cards the Player wants to chain. We will use std::list to support random access by gemstone type.
/*
 The class TradeArea will have to hold cards openly and support random access insertion and removal. The TradeArea holds cards in a std::list.
 TradeArea& operator+=( Card* ) adds the card to the trade area but it does not check if it is legal to place the card.
 bool legal( Card* ) returns true if the card can be legally added to the TradeArea, i.e., a card of the same gemstone is already in the TradeArea.
 Card* trade( string ) removes a card of the corresponding gemstone name from the trade area. int numCards() returns the number of cards currently in the trade area.
 Also add the insertion operator to insert all the cards of the trade area to an std::ostream.
 The TradeArea needs a constructor which accepts an std::istream and reconstruct the TradeArea from file.
 TradeArea( std::istream&, CardFactory* )
