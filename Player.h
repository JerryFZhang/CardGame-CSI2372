 Also add the insertion operator to print a Player to an std::ostream. The player's name, the number of coins in the player's possession and each of the chains (2 or 3, some possibly empty) should be printed. Note that the Hand is printed with a separate function. The player printout may look as follows:
 Jane     3 coins
 Ruby     R R R R
 Quartz   Q
 Player needs a constructor which accepts an std::istream and reconstruct the Player from file. Player( std::istream&, CardFactory* )
