#include "DiscardPile.hpp"
//DiscardPile must support insertion and removal but not at random locations but all at the end. Again a std::vector will work fine but here we can use simple aggregation.

/*
 The DiscardPile holds cards in a std::vector and is similar to Deck.
 DiscardPile& operator+=( Card* ) discards the card to the pile.
 Card* pickUp() returns and removes the top card from the discard pile.
 Card* top() returns but does not remove the top card from the discard pile.
 void print( std::ostream& ) to insert all the cards in the DiscardPile to an std::ostream.
 Also add the insertion operator to insert only the top card of the discard pile to an std::ostream. The DiscardPile needs a constructor which accepts an std::istream and reconstructs the
 DiscardPile from file.
 DiscardPile( std::istream&, CardFactory* )
